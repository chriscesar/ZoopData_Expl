# ZoopData_Expl
Explorations into zooplankton data

The aim of this is to import the estuarine and coastal zooplankton monitoring data
gathered as part of the Environment Agency's monitoring programme.

# To-do list
* Generate report investigating drivers of change in inshore zooplankton data
* What is the bigger picture?
  + are some regions different to others?
* consider regional and temporal differences in taxon diversity and density
* how do these parameters link to environmental pressures? (nutrients, temperature, salinity)
* Do relative proportions of zooplankton lifeforms show regional differences? (e.g., Large:Small copepods)

##########
* add x-axis to TS
* Generate kool graphs
