# ZoopData_Expl
Import and explore zooplankton data gathered by the Environment Agency since 2022 around the English coast.

# To-do list
* Generate report investigating drivers of change in inshore zooplankton data
* What is the bigger picture?
  + are some regions different to others?
* consider regional and temporal differences in taxon diversity and density
* how do these parameters link to environmental pressures? (nutrients, temperature, salinity)
* Do relative proportions of zooplankton lifeforms show regional differences? (e.g., Large:Small copepods)
* **Update 'carbon content' variable names to specify units.  e.g., currently have names like 'md_carbTot_m3'.  Should be 'md_ug_carbTot_m3'**
* **look at variability of 'clustered' sites (Solent, Kent, (Northumberland?))**
